# Illustrator Typography Check Script

This project aims to develop a script for Adobe Illustrator that automates typography checks for design files. The script will help designers and typographers ensure consistency and accuracy in typography usage, improving the overall quality of designs.

## Features

- **Mark Anchors without Handlers:** The script will identify and mark anchor points in paths that do not have proper handlers, helping designers identify potential issues with path control and smoothness.

- **Mark Paths Not Closed:** The script will detect open paths and mark them, making it easier for designers to identify and close any unclosed paths that could impact the final design output.

- **Mark Non-Octagonal Paths:** The script will identify paths that are not perfectly octagonal, enabling designers to quickly identify and rectify any irregularities that might affect the overall visual harmony.

- **Alert Document General Info:** The script will provide an alert displaying relevant information about the document, such as color mode, artboard dimensions, and linked files, giving designers a quick overview of the project's specifications.
